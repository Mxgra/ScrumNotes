# ScrumNotes
 
This really is just a simple Django App, which features a scrum board for todos and note taking. It contains three cards, or progress levels for todos, namely "todo", "doing" and "done", just like in other scrum boards. Special feature is a "Productivity ColorGrid", which shows you your productivity of your work days.

Its currently only tested in development mode.
